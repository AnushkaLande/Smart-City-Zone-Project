Smart City Zoning using IoT sensor data with KMeans clustering and KNN classification for real-time zone prediction and monitoring.

# Smart City Zoning using IoT Sensor Data

This project builds an intelligent zoning system for smart cities by using IoT sensor data and machine learning techniques.  
It clusters different city areas based on environmental and traffic parameters and predicts zones for new data in real-time.

## üöÄ Project Overview

- **Objective**:  
  To divide a smart city into meaningful zones based on:
  - Air quality (PM2.5 levels)
  - Noise pollution
  - Temperature
  - Traffic density
  - Location (latitude and longitude)

- **Techniques Used**:
  - **KMeans Clustering**: To identify and group similar city regions.
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: To classify new sensor readings into the correct zone.

- **Outcome**:  
  Dynamic, real-time zoning for better urban planning, traffic management, and environmental monitoring.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn (KMeans, KNN)
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualizations)
- (Optional) Folium (for real map visualization)
